Description: A comprehensive implementation of Petersen-type estimators
    and its many variants for two-sample capture-recapture studies.
    A conditional likelihood approach is used that allows
    for tag loss; non reporting of tags; reward tags; categorical, geographical and temporal stratification;
    partial stratification; reverse capture-recapture;
    and continuous variables in modeling the probability of capture.
    Many examples from fisheries management are presented.
